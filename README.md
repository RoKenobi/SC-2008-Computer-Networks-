The lab work i have done this sem. 
One thing to rememeber the labs are all focused on the part2 of course so it kinda feels out of place and wtff is happening. 

Lab 1 - is pretty simple basic commands in cmd like ipconfig and stuff.
Lab 2 - It has 2 java files just compile and run them in terminal. ALso change the name, group numbers , ip address in the file respectively
Lab 3 - This one is a complete mind fck cause you practically do not get what the helly is happening.
Lab 4 - This is one is simple you are given a dataset from that you write relevant code to determine whatever questions they ask
